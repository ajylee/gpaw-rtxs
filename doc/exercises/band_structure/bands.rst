Band structure

Band diagrams are usefull analysis tools. Read
:svn:`~doc/exercises/band_structure/Na_band.py` and try to
understand what it does, then use it to construct the band diagram of
bulk Na and Si. Read
:svn:`~doc/exercises/band_structure/plot_band.py` and try
to understand it, then use it to plot the band diagram.

Compare the Si band diagram to the band diagram below (adapted from
Cohen and Chelikowsky: "Electronic Structure and Optical Properties of
Semiconductors" Solid-State Sciences 75, Springer-Verlag 1988).  How
does this correspond to the DOS calculation in the previous exercise?
