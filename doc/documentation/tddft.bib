Abstract = {{Optical absorption of a gold nanocluster of 102 Au atoms protected by 44
   para-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA) ligands is measured in the range of
   0.05-6.2 eV (mid-IR to UV) by a combination of several techniques for
   purified samples in solid and solution phases. The results are compared
   to calculations for a model cluster Au(102)(SMe)(44) based on the
   time-dependent density functional theory in the linear-response regime
   and using the known structure of Au(102)(p-MBA)(44). The measured and
   calculated molar absorption coefficients in the NIR-vis region are
   comparable, within a factor of 2, in the absolute scale. Several
   characteristic features are observed in the absorption in the range of
   1.5-3.5 eV. The onset of the electronic transitions in the mid-IR region
   is experimentally observed at 0.45 +/- 0.05 eV which compares well with
   the lowest calculated transition at 0.55 eV. Vibrations in the ligand
   layer give rise to fingerprint IR features below the onset of low-energy
   metal-to-metal electronic transitions. Partial exchange of the p-MBA
   ligand to glutathione does not affect the onset of the electronic
   transitions, which indicates that the metal core of the cluster is not
   affected by the ligand exchange. The full spectroscopic characterization
   of the Au(102)(p-MBA)(44) reported here for the first time gives
   benchmarks for further studies of manipulation and functionalization of
   this nanocluster to various applications.}},

Abstract = {{Many thiolate-protected gold clusters prepared by wet-chemistry show
   abundances of certain compositions which can be explained by the
   shell-closing of the superatom orbitals 1S, 1P, 1D, ... , leading to
   magic-number series 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 58, etc. One recently isolated
   such cluster, Au(44)(SPh)(28)(2-), is a potential candidate for the
   magic number 18, although its structure has not been determined.
   Applying the ``divide-and-protect{''} concept and recent knowledge
   obtained from the structures of Au(25)(SR)(18)(-) and Au(102)(SR)(44)
   (-SR being a thiolate group), we compare two structural models for the
   Au(44)(SR)(28)(2-) cluster. We have optimized their structures, computed
   powder X-ray diffraction patterns and optical absorption spectra, and
   performed the superatom analysis on them. The model featuring the
   -RS-Au-SR- and -RS-Au-SR-Au-SR- motifs in the protective layer shows
   better energetic stability and agreement with the experimental XRD
   pattern than the other model which has a protective layer including
   longer, polymeric RS(AuSR)(x) motifs. However, the computed optical
   spectra for both models are quite different from the experimental one.
   Our models here can serve as benchmarks for further proposals of
   Au(44)(SR)(28)(2-) cluster structures.}},

Title = {{Electronic structure calculations with GPAW: a real-space implementation
   of the projector augmented-wave method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in
   many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the
   Kohn-Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies
   the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with
   several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector
   augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package
   (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw) using a uniform real-space grid
   representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more
   traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space
   grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational
   scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique
   feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in
   addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to
   the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between
   the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one
   to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional
   theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have
   implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the
   linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport
   calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW
   using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In
   addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also
   describe the implementation of selected exchange-correlation
   functionals, parallelization schemes, Delta SCF-method, x-ray absorption
   spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2010}},

Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We calculate single-particle excitation energies for a series of 34
   molecules using fully self-consistent GW, one-shot G(0)W(0),
   Hartree-Fock (HF), and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). All
   calculations are performed within the projector-augmented wave method
   using a basis set of Wannier functions augmented by numerical atomic
   orbitals. The GW self-energy is calculated on the real frequency axis
   including its full frequency dependence and off-diagonal matrix
   elements. The mean absolute error of the ionization potential (IP) with
   respect to experiment is found to be 4.4, 2.6, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.5 eV for
   DFT-PBE, DFT-PBE0, HF, G(0)W(0) (HF), and self-consistent GW,
   respectively. This shows that although electronic screening is weak in
   molecular systems, its inclusion at the GW level reduces the error in
   the IP by up to 50\% relative to unscreened HF. In general GW
   overscreens the HF energies leading to underestimation of the IPs. The
   best IPs are obtained from one-shot G(0)W(0) calculations based on HF
   since this reduces the overscreening. Finally, we find that the
   inclusion of core-valence exchange is important and can affect the
   excitation energies by as much as 1 eV.}},

   properties of methylthiolate-protected bimetal PdAu(24)(SR)(18)(z) (R =

   Gronbeck, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2008, 130, 3756]. The atomic structure of

   H. Hakkinen, M. Walter and H. Gronbeck, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006, 110,
   9927] as Au(13){[}Au(2)(SR)(3)](6)((-1)) where 6 v-shaped Au(2)(SR)(3)
   ligands protect the close-to-icosahedral Au(13) core and where eight
   delocalized metal electrons, derived from Au(6s) electrons, comprise a
   stable closed-shell 1S(2)1P(6) ``superatom'' configuration in the core.
   We show that the di-anion PdAu(24)(SR)(18)((-2)) is a corresponding
   eight-electron closed-shell species whereas the clusters
   PdAu(24)(SR)(18)(z), -1 <= z <= + 3, have holes in the 1P HOMO manifold.
   This indicates that the doping Pd atom remains close to the zero-valent
   4d(10)5s(0) configuration and does not contribute electrons to the
   delocalized electron density in the gold core. Structural optimization
   shows that the all-gold ``divide-and-protect'' structure motif is robust
   with respect to replacing the Au by Pd at the center of the core, at the
   surface of the core or in one of the protecting Au(2)(SR)(3) ligands.
   However, optical absorption and the HOMO-LUMO and electrochemical gaps
   depend sensitively on the site of the doping Pd atom, which may turn out
   be useful for assigning the structure of PdAu(24)(SR)(18) from
   experimental data.}},
