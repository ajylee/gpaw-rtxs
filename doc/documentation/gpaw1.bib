Abstract = {{We present an implementation of the linear density response function
   within the projector-augmented wave method with applications to the
   linear optical and dielectric properties of both solids, surfaces, and
   interfaces. The response function is represented in plane waves while
   the single-particle eigenstates can be expanded on a real space grid or
   in atomic-orbital basis for increased efficiency. The
   exchange-correlation kernel is treated at the level of the adiabatic
   local density approximation (ALDA) and crystal local field effects are
   included. The calculated static and dynamical dielectric functions of
   Si, C, SiC, AlP, and GaAs compare well with previous calculations. While
   optical properties of semiconductors, in particular excitonic effects,
   are generally not well described by ALDA, we obtain excellent agreement
   with experiments for the surface loss function of graphene and the
   Mg(0001) surface with plasmon energies deviating by less than 0.2 eV.
   Finally, the method is applied to study the influence of substrates on
   the plasmon excitations in graphene.}},

   density functional calculations, we postulate that excited plasmons on
   the silver surface act to populate O(2) antibonding orbitals and so form
   a transient negative-ion state, which thereby facilitates the

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory we have studied the adsorption
   properties of different atoms and molecules deposited on a
   stoichiometric, reduced, and oxidized rutile TiO(2)(110) surface.
   Depending on the oxidation state of the surface, electrons can flow from
   or to the substrate and, therefore, negatively or positively charged
   species are expected. In particular, we have found that a charge
   transfer process from or to the surface always occurs for highly
   electronegative or highly electropositive species, respectively. For
   atoms or molecules with intermediate electron affinity, the direction of
   the charge flow depends on the oxidation state of the rutile surface and
   on the adsorption site. Generally, the charging effect leads to more
   stable complexes. However, the increase in the binding energy of the
   adsorbates is highly dependent on the electronic states of the surface
   prior to the adsorption event. In this work we have analyzed in details
   these mechanisms and we have also established a direct correlation
   between the enhanced binding energy of the adsorbates and the induced

Abstract = {{The atomic layer deposition of aluminum oxide on an OH-terminated

   Calculations show that even one Al(2)O(3) ALD cycle is enough to block
   N3 adsorption on the TiO(2). Consequently, N3 anchors to the aluminum
   oxide layer, which increases the dye-TiO(2) distance by similar to 2
   angstrom, changes the adsorption site, and weakens the coupling to
   TiO(2). All these factors suppress forward electron injection from the

Abstract = {{Electronic and spectral properties of small TiO(2) particles have been
   studied in order to gain more knowledge on their dependence on the

   recently developed light scattering based method for determining
   submicrometer size particles to nanoparticles. For that, we need to know
   how the refractive index function depends on the cluster size. As a
   first step, we have used time-dependent density functional theory
   (TDDFT) calculations having a focus on the shape changes of the
   calculated spectra, which can be related to changes in the refractive
   index function. Starting from the structure of TiO(2) molecule for the
   two smallest particles and truncated bulk anatase structure for larger
   particles, the structures for (TiO(2))(n) clusters, n = \{1, 2, 8, 18,
   28, 38\}, have been modeled. After the structure optimization using
   standard density functional theory (DFT) approach, the photoabsorption

   using TDDFT calculations. The results show slight evidence of the band
   gap broadening in the case of three out of the smallest particles and
   strong structural dependence of electronic and spectral properties,

   structure, and breaking of the crystal symmetry as the size of the

   small particles their refractive index function can differ from the bulk
   values, and this has to be taken into account in the interpretation of

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical investigation of the hydrogenation of pyrene

   atomic hydrogen to pyrene is found to be exothermic by up to 1.6 eV with
   a strong site dependence. The edge C atoms are found most reactive. The
   barrier for the formation of the hydrogen-pyrene bond is small, down to
   0.06 eV. A second hydrogen binds barrierless at many sites. The most
   stable structure of dihydrogenpyrene is more stable by 0.64 eV than
   pyrene plus a molecular hydrogen molecule and a large barrier of 3.7 eV

Abstract = {{A realistic treatment of metallic and semimetallic systems in polar

   demonstrated for graphene and metallic single-wall carbon nanotubes. The
   model is easily parametrized and gives an approximate description of the

Abstract = {{Transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) is a promising spectroscopic tool

   relate the voltage at the minimum V(min) to the closest molecular level.
   Importantly, V(min) is approximately half the voltage required to see a
   peak in the dI/dV curve. Information about the molecular level position
   can thus be obtained at relatively low voltages. In this work we show
   that the molecular level position can be determined at even lower

   alpha < 2. On the basis of a simple Lorentzian transmission model we
   analyze theoretical ab initio as well as experimental I -V curves and

   adhesion between the CNT and a pure Ni cluster is stronger than between
   the same CNT and a Ni carbide cluster although the energy difference was
   small compared to the total adhesion energies. This adhesion strength
   implies that CNTs are likely to remain attached to both pure Ni and Ni
   carbide clusters and that either pure Ni or Ni carbide clusters may be
   docked onto the open CNT ends to achieve continued growth or electronic
   contacts between CNTs and electrode materials. The system with a CNT
   attached to a pure Ni cluster was found to be energetically favored
   compared to a system containing the same CNT attached to a Ni carbide.
   The difference in total energy implies that a CNT should act as a sink
   for C atoms dissolved in the Ni carbide cluster, which means that the
   dissolved C atoms will be drained from the cluster, yielding a pure
   metal in the zero Kelvin thermodynamic limit. It is argued that this

Abstract = {{We present a systematic study of electronic gap states in defected

   applying a sufficiently large value for the Hubbard-U parameter of the
   Ti 3d states, the excess electrons localize spatially at the Ti sites
   and appear as states in the band gap. At U=2.5 eV, the position in
   energy of these gap states are in fair agreement with the experimental

   eV, all of these end up in gap states that are spatially localized
   around specific Ti atoms, thus effectively creating one Ti(3+) ion per
   excess electron. An important result of this investigation is that
   regardless of which structural defect is the origin of the gap states,

Abstract = {{We study the effect of temporal correlation in a Langevin equation
   describing nonadiabatic dynamics at metal surfaces. For a harmonic
   oscillator, the Langevin equation preserves the quantum dynamics exactly
   and it is demonstrated that memory effects are needed in order to
   conserve the ground state energy of the oscillator. We then compare the
   result of Langevin dynamics in a harmonic potential with a perturbative
   master equation approach and show that the Langevin equation gives a
   better description in the nonperturbative range of high temperatures and
   large friction. Unlike the master equation, this approach is readily
   extended to anharmonic potentials. Using density functional theory, we
   calculate representative Langevin trajectories for associative
   desorption of N(2) from Ru(0001) and find that memory effects lower the
   dissipation of energy. Finally, we propose an ab initio scheme to
   calculate the temporal correlation function and dynamical friction
   within density functional theory. (C) 2010 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Many thiolate-protected gold clusters prepared by wet-chemistry show
   abundances of certain compositions which can be explained by the
   shell-closing of the superatom orbitals 1S, 1P, 1D, ... , leading to
   magic-number series 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 58, etc. One recently isolated
   such cluster, Au(44)(SPh)(28)(2-), is a potential candidate for the
   magic number 18, although its structure has not been determined.
   Applying the ``divide-and-protect{''} concept and recent knowledge
   obtained from the structures of Au(25)(SR)(18)(-) and Au(102)(SR)(44)
   (-SR being a thiolate group), we compare two structural models for the
   Au(44)(SR)(28)(2-) cluster. We have optimized their structures, computed
   powder X-ray diffraction patterns and optical absorption spectra, and
   performed the superatom analysis on them. The model featuring the
   -RS-Au-SR- and -RS-Au-SR-Au-SR- motifs in the protective layer shows
   better energetic stability and agreement with the experimental XRD
   pattern than the other model which has a protective layer including
   longer, polymeric RS(AuSR)(x) motifs. However, the computed optical
   spectra for both models are quite different from the experimental one.
   Our models here can serve as benchmarks for further proposals of
   Au(44)(SR)(28)(2-) cluster structures.}},

Abstract = {{We model a Kohn-Sham potential with the discontinuity at integer

   the discontinuity to obtain the quasiparticle gap. This allows us to
   compare the Kohn-Sham gaps to those obtained by accurate many-body
   perturbation-theory-based optimized potential methods. In addition, the
   resulting quasiparticle band gap is compared to experimental gaps. In
   the GLLB model potential, the exchange-correlation hole is modeled using
   a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) energy density and the
   response of the hole-to-density variations is evaluated by using the
   common-denominator approximation and homogeneous electron-gas-based
   assumptions. In our modification, we have chosen the PBEsol potential as
   the GGA to model the exchange hole and add a consistent correlation
   potential. The method is implemented in the GPAW code, which allows
   efficient parallelization to study large systems. A fair agreement for

Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Density functional calculations were performed in order to investigate
   CO oxidation on two of the most stable bulk PdO surfaces. The most
   stable PdO(100) surface, with oxygen excess, is inert against CO
   adsorption, whereas strong adsorption on the stoichiometric PdO(101)
   surface leads to favorable oxidation via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
   mechanism. The reaction with a surface oxygen atom has an activation
   energy of 0.66 eV, which is comparable to the lowest activation energies
   observed on metallic surfaces. However, the reaction rate may be limited
   by the coverage of molecular oxygen. Actually, the reaction with the
   site blocking molecular oxygen is slightly more favorable, enabling also
   possible formation of carbonate surface species at low temperatures. The
   extreme activity of strongly bonded surface oxygen atoms is more greatly
   emphasized on the PdO(100)-O surface. The direct reaction without
   adsorption, following the Eley-Rideal mechanism and taking advantage of
   the reaction tunnel provided by the adjacent palladium atom, has an
   activation energy of only 0.24 eV. The reaction mechanism and activation
   energy for the palladium activated CO oxidation on the most stable

   a cold welding of the DLC/DLC tribo-surfaces, leading to the formation
   of a transfer film (transferred from one DLC partner to the other) and
   the establishment of a new tribo-interface with a low friction

Abstract = {{Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in
   many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the
   Kohn-Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies
   the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with
   several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector
   augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package
   (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw) using a uniform real-space grid
   representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more
   traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space
   grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational
   scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique
   feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in
   addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to
   the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between
   the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one
   to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional
   theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have
   implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the
   linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport
   calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW
   using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In
   addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also
   describe the implementation of selected exchange-correlation
   functionals, parallelization schemes, Delta SCF-method, x-ray absorption
   spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.}},

Abstract = {{The progress of ligand exchange reactions between the ligands of
   Au(25)(SR)(18)(-) nanoparticles (SR = S(CH(2))(2)Ph) and thiols with
   electron-withdrawing substituents (HSPh-p-X; X = Br, NO(2)) was
   monitored using nuclear magnetic resonance. As the reactions proceed,
   the introduction of the electron withdrawing SPhX ligands into the
   nanoparticle ligand shell causes a shift of the nanoparticle redox waves
   (Au25(1+/0)) and Au(25)(0/1-)) to more positive potentials. Combining
   the NMR and electrochemical results reveals a nearly linear shift of the
   redox formal potentials as a function of the average number of exchanged
   ligands: similar to 42 and 25 mV/ligand for X = NO(2) and Br,
   respectively. Using a simple model electron-withdrawing ligand
   (-SCH(2)Cl), density functional theory (DFT) was used to study in detail
   the effects on the nanoparticle electronic structure caused by exchange
   of this ligand for -SCH(3). The calculations show how the
   electronegative X group changes the polarization of the nanoparticle and
   the chargedistribution among the ligands, the protecting
   (-SR-Au-SR-Au-SR) semirings, and the Au(13) core. The HOMO-LUMO gap is
   unchanged by the ligand exchanges; both states are equally stabilized by
   the presence of each incoming ligand, by 60 mV/ligand. Charge analysis
   suggests no significant changes in the Au(13) core, even after complete
   exchange. Rather, the charge is transferred inside the ligands, mostly
   from nearest-neighbor atoms of the semirings.}},

   mechanism for the penetration of thin films and other nanoscopic

   are soft-landed onto a monolayer of C(60) supported by gold sink through
   the monolayer in a matter of hours. However, the clusters are stable
   when landed onto two monolayers of C(60) supported on gold, or on one

Abstract = {{The structure of adsorbed bare and oxidised Pd(9) clusters on a MgO(001)
   bilayer supported by an Ag(001) surface are studied by density

   corresponding calculations of Pd9 on a free-standing MgO(001) trilayer -
   a system that already reproduces the adsorption properties of thick MgO
   films. A 3D double trigonal antiprism is compared to a 2D fragment of a
   Pd(111) plane. In contrast to the findings for gold clusters, the Pd(9)
   3D ground state on a thick MgO film is still energetically favourable on
   a thin metal supported MgO film - despite the substantial charge
   transfer from the metal support to the 2D cluster. Simulated scanning
   tunnelling microscopy images predict that the oxide formation should be
   easily detectable for negative bias voltages, since the highest occupied
   molecular orbitals of both the pristine as well as the oxidised clusters
   possess a strong Pd(d) contribution localised on the Pd atoms. At
   positive bias, the nodal structure of delocalised unoccupied orbitals
   sometimes masks the nuclear positions.

Abstract = {{Finely dispersed nanometre-scale gold particles are known to catalyse
   several oxidation reactions in aerobic, ambient conditions. The
   catalytic activity has been explained by various complementary
   mechanisms, including support effects, particle-size-dependent
   metal-insulator transition, charging effects, frontier orbital
   interactions and geometric fluxionality. We show, by considering a
   series of robust and structurally well-characterized ligand-protected
   gold clusters with diameters between 1.2 and 2.4 nm, that electronic
   quantum size effects, particularly the magnitude of the so-called
   HOMO-LUMO energy gap, has a decisive role in binding oxygen to the
   nano-catalyst in an activated form. This can lead to the oxidation
   reaction 2CO+O(2) -> 2CO(2) with low activation barriers. Binding of
   dioxygen is significant only for the smallest particles with a metal

   externally exciting a vibrational mode of the molecule. The analysis is
   quite general but requires that the molecular orbital does not hybridize
   strongly with the metallic states. As an example we perform a
   density-functional theory analysis of a benzene molecule between two
   Au(111) contacts and show that exciting a particular vibrational mode
   can give rise to transmission of a single electron.}},

Abstract = {{We calculate single-particle excitation energies for a series of 34
   molecules using fully self-consistent GW, one-shot G(0)W(0),
   Hartree-Fock (HF), and hybrid density-functional theory (DFT). All
   calculations are performed within the projector-augmented wave method
   using a basis set of Wannier functions augmented by numerical atomic
   orbitals. The GW self-energy is calculated on the real frequency axis
   including its full frequency dependence and off-diagonal matrix
   elements. The mean absolute error of the ionization potential (IP) with
   respect to experiment is found to be 4.4, 2.6, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.5 eV for
   DFT-PBE, DFT-PBE0, HF, G(0)W(0) (HF), and self-consistent GW,
   respectively. This shows that although electronic screening is weak in
   molecular systems, its inclusion at the GW level reduces the error in
   the IP by up to 50\% relative to unscreened HF. In general GW
   overscreens the HF energies leading to underestimation of the IPs. The
   best IPs are obtained from one-shot G(0)W(0) calculations based on HF

Abstract = {{Tuning of effective band gaps at insulator surfaces by adsorbed
   molecules is of fundamental interest but also technologically relevant
   for contact charging induced by adsorbed molecules like hydroxybenzoic
   acids. Our studies by density functional theory of the adsorption of
   benzoic acid (BA), salicylic acid (SA), and para-salicylic acid (p-SA)
   on perfect KCl and NaCl(100) surfaces as well as on polar and nonpolar
   step edges reveal the importance of polar defects in this context. We
   also found that the van der Waals dispersion contributes to about half
   of the adsorption energy in most cases. Therefore, the van der Waals
   interaction must be explicitly taken into account even for the
   interaction between molecules and wide band gap insulator surfaces,
   respective of the adsorption on flat or stepped surfaces. On the other
   hand, the adsorption geometry is still determined by short-range forces,
   that is, by the weak chemical bonds and electrostatic interactions.
   These short-range interactions are mostly mediated by resonant coupling
   between HOMO-1 and HOMO-2 molecular states and the valence band of the
   solid, which results in very similar adsorption energies of these
   molecules on the KCl and NaCl surfaces. The interaction strength is
   significantly modified only at defects with large dipole moments (e.g.,
   pairs of polar steps) resulting in split-off edge states below the
   valence band. Resonant coupling to these states leads to an almost rigid
   down-shift of all molecular orbitals that efficiently reduces the
   effective band gap at the Surface. As a result, an effective band gap of
   0.9 eV has been achieved oil the polar KCl {[}011] stepped Surface
   thanks to the relatively small HOMO-LUMO gap of SA.}},

   higher binding energy compared to pure platinum. The effect of this

Abstract = {{We present density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the
   hydrogenation (HYD) and direct desulfurization (DDS) pathways of
   thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) over cobalt-promoted MoS(2). We
   find that the Co-Mo-S edge in its equilibrium state under HDS conditions
   is reactive toward both hydrogenation and C-S bond scission without the
   initial creation of vacancies. This can be accomplished such that
   additional S is bound to the Co-Mo-S subsequent to C-S bond scission and
   then removed in the final reaction step. We find thus that
   coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) are present in the equilibrium
   structure, and at these sites HDS can take place without sulfur removal
   in the first step. No traditional vacancies are formed and the present
   mechanism is therefore very different from the previously proposed
   vacancy mechanisms requiring the initial creation of a sulfur vacancy
   for the reaction to proceed. We find that Co-promotion decreases the
   barrier of hydrogenation reactions and active site regeneration but
   increases the barrier of C-S-scission reactions. The net result of Co
   promotion is found to be an increase in the hydrogenation activity and
   also of the relative importance of the DDS pathway. We compare our
   results to available experimental information and find a number of
   consistencies and parallels. Therefore, we can rationalize the promoting
   effect of Co such that at the Co-Mo-S edge, good hydrogenation
   properties are combined with the ability to bind additional sulfur upon
   C-S-scission. Finally, we propose that the interactions between the
   Co-promoted S-edge and the non-promoted Mo-edge may play a role in the
   hydrogenation pathway. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A wide range of experiments have established that certain chemical

   hot electrons which reproduces this power law and the observed exponents
   of several experiments. All parameters are calculated within density
   functional theory and the delta self-consistent field method. With a

Abstract = {{We demonstrate, via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements
   performed at 48 K, the existence of ``bright beaches{''} at the edges of
   K islands (diameter similar to 5-500 nm) on the graphite surface. The
   enhanced tunneling current is only observed in monolayer-high islands on
   graphite, and not in islands of similar geometry on top of a K monolayer
   film. First-principles density functional calculations and STM
   simulations suggest that this is an STM field effect, which appears as
   the positive tip attracts donated electrons back to the metallic K
   islands. The restored charge accumulates preferentially at the island
   edges.}},

Abstract = {{The density functional theory is used to examine the electronic
   structure of small Au clusters, supported on rutile TiO(2)(110) surfaces
   having subsurface Ti-interstitials. The interstitials reduce the surface
   and we find that negatively charged gold clusters are stabilized with
   respect to the stoichiometric surface. The behavior of the open-shell
   gold clusters can be rationalized in terms of the highest occupied
   molecular orbitals and the resulting electron affinities. The relative
   stabilities of closed-shell gold clusters led to recent disagreements in
   the literature. We show that they are very dependent on the density
   functional used. As expected, a redshift in the CO stretch vibration is
   calculated for CO adsorbed on a negatively charged cluster. Somewhat
   surprisingly a larger redshift is found for CO adsorbed on an overall
   positively charged Au(3) cluster. This is explained by CO being a local
   probe of the individual Au charges and one Au atom having an electron
   accumulation.}},

   properties of methylthiolate-protected bimetal PdAu(24)(SR)(18)(z) (R =

   Gronbeck, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2008, 130, 3756]. The atomic structure of

   9927] as Au(13){[}Au(2)(SR)(3)](6)((-1)) where 6 v-shaped Au(2)(SR)(3)
   ligands protect the close-to-icosahedral Au(13) core and where eight
   delocalized metal electrons, derived from Au(6s) electrons, comprise a
   stable closed-shell 1S(2)1P(6) ``superatom'' configuration in the core.
   We show that the di-anion PdAu(24)(SR)(18)((-2)) is a corresponding
   eight-electron closed-shell species whereas the clusters
   PdAu(24)(SR)(18)(z), -1 <= z <= + 3, have holes in the 1P HOMO manifold.
   This indicates that the doping Pd atom remains close to the zero-valent
   4d(10)5s(0) configuration and does not contribute electrons to the
   delocalized electron density in the gold core. Structural optimization
   shows that the all-gold ``divide-and-protect'' structure motif is robust
   with respect to replacing the Au by Pd at the center of the core, at the
   surface of the core or in one of the protecting Au(2)(SR)(3) ligands.
   However, optical absorption and the HOMO-LUMO and electrochemical gaps
   depend sensitively on the site of the doping Pd atom, which may turn out
   be useful for assigning the structure of PdAu(24)(SR)(18) from
   experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The ambient temperature equations of state (EoS) of iron, cobalt,

   diffraction. These transition metals were compressed using diamond anvil
   cells with a helium pressure transmitting medium. The maximum pressure

   200 GPa (for iron). This work completes previous measurements on six
   other metals {[}Phys. Rev. B 70, 094112 (2004)] to quantify the
   differences between ab initio calculations and experiment on a large
   experimental set of transition metals. The compression curves of iron,

   calculated ab initio within the density-functional theory (DFT)
   formalism using the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method and different
   exchange-correlation functionals (LDA, GGA-PBE, GGA-PBEsol). The
   difference between PAW and available all-electron calculations is found
   to be negligible up to very high pressures. The success of each
   exchange-correlation functional is correlated with the atomic number.
   For all metals, the bulk modulus becomes overestimated at high pressure.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We present a modification of the Delta self-consistent field (Delta SCF)
   method of calculating energies of excited states in order to make it
   applicable to resonance calculations of molecules adsorbed on metal
   surfaces, where the molecular orbitals are highly hybridized. The Delta
   SCF approximation is a density-functional method closely resembling
   standard density-functional theory (DFT), the only difference being that
   in Delta SCF one or more electrons are placed in higher lying Kohn-Sham
   orbitals instead of placing all electrons in the lowest possible
   orbitals as one does when calculating the ground-state energy within
   standard DFT. We extend the Delta SCF method by allowing excited
   electrons to occupy orbitals which are linear combinations of Kohn-Sham
   orbitals. With this extra freedom it is possible to place charge locally
   on adsorbed molecules in the calculations, such that resonance energies
   can be estimated, which is not possible in traditional Delta SCF because
   of very delocalized Kohn-Sham orbitals. The method is applied to N(2),
   CO, and NO adsorbed on different metallic surfaces and compared to
   ordinary Delta SCF without our modification, spatially constrained DFT,
   and inverse-photoemission spectroscopy measurements. This comparison
   shows that the modified Delta SCF method gives results in close
   agreement with experiment, significantly closer than the comparable
   methods. For N(2) adsorbed on ruthenium (0001) we map out a
   two-dimensional part of the potential energy surfaces in the ground
   state and the 2 pi resonance. From this we conclude that an electron
   hitting the resonance can induce molecular motion, optimally with 1.5 eV
   transferred to atomic movement. Finally we present some performance test
   of the Delta SCF approach on gas-phase N(2) and CO in order to compare
   the results to higher accuracy methods. Here we find that excitation
   energies are approximated with accuracy close to that of time-dependent
   density-functional theory. Especially we see very good agreement in the
   minimum shift of the potential energy surfaces in the excited state
   compared to the ground state.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis, characterization, and functionalization of self-assembled,
   ligand-stabilized gold nanoparticles are long-standing issues in the

   provide a unified view of principles that underlie the stability of
   particles protected by thiolate (SR) or phosphine and halide (PR(3), X)
   ligands. The picture has emerged from analysis of large-scale density
   functional theory calculations of structurally characterized compounds,
   namely Au(102)(SR)(44), Au(39)(PR(3))(14)X(6)(-), Au(11)(PR(3))(7)X(3),
   and Au(13)(PR(3))(10)X(2)(3+), where X is either a halogen or a
   thiolate. Attributable to a compact, symmetric core and complete steric
   protection, each compound has a filled spherical electronic shell and a
   major energy gap to unoccupied states. Consequently, the exceptional
   stability is best described by a ``noble-gas superatom{''} analogy. The
   explanatory power of this concept is shown by its application to many
   monomeric and oligomeric compounds of precisely known composition and
   structure, and its predictive power is indicated through suggestions
   offered for a series of anomalously stable cluster compositions which
   are still awaiting a precise structure determination.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We describe an implementation of density functional theory that is
   formulated fully in configuration space, where all wave functions,
   densities, and potentials are represented on a grid. Central to the
   method is a fourth-order factorization of the evolution operator for the
   Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. Special attention is paid to nonlocal
   pseudopotentials of the Kleinman-Bylander type, which are necessary for
   a quantitatively accurate description of molecules, clusters, and
   solids. It is shown that the fourth-order factorization improves the
   computational efficiency of the method by about an order of magnitude
   compared with second-order schemes. We use the Ono-Hirose filtering
   method to reduce the resolution of the grid used for representing the
   wave functions. Some care is needed to maintain the fourth-order
   convergence using filtered projectors, and the necessary precautions are
   discussed. We apply the method to an isolated carbon atom as well as the
   carbon-monoxide molecule, the benzene molecule, and the
   buckminsterfullerene cluster, obtaining quantitative agreement with
   previous results. The convergence of the method with respect to time
   step, grid resolution, and filtering method is discussed in detail.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{124}},

Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{A scheme for the Fourier filtering of pseudopotentials in real space
   calculations is proposed, in order to reduce the artifact of positional
   energy dependence ({''}egg box{''} effect). It is based on an improved
   version of the mask function method poposed by Wang {[}Phys. Rev. B 64,
   201107/1 (2001)]. It is easy to implement, efficient, and accurate. By
   using atom-centered compensation charges, the local part of the
   pseudopotential becomes short ranged and can be filtered on the same
   footing as the nonlocal parts. A major advantage of the approach is that
   a generic set of parameters can be used for different pseudopotentials.
   A balanced parameter set is derived and validated. In this context a
   strategy to monitor the extent of grid dependence is introduced. It is
   found that, given a sufficiently fine grid spacing is used to represent
   the atomic valence density, the positional energy dependence can be
   reduced below 0.1 mhartree for all investigated atoms. On the example of
   a D-3h symmetric Si-5 cluster and the C-60 molecule it is demonstrated
   that the artificial symmetry breaking of both bond lengths and orbital
   energies can substantially be reduced by the filtering scheme. (c) 2006

   density matrix expressed in a psinc basis set. We describe in detail the
   novel algorithms we have developed for computing with the psinc basis
   set the quantities needed in the evaluation and optimisation of the
   total energy within our approach. For our parallel computations we use
   the general Message Passing Interface (MPI) library of subroutines to

   efficient schemes for distributing data and computational load to
   processors in a balanced manner. We describe these schemes in detail and

Abstract = {{A Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics implementation using real space
   discretized wavefunctions on equidistant Cartesian grids is presented.
   By using numerically discretized Laplace operators of higher order for
   the evaluation of the electronic kinetic energy as well as for the
   Poisson equation the total energy expression can be evaluated purely
   with local operations. Details of our implementation of microcanonical
   and canonical Car-Parrinello joint dynamics of nuclei and wavefunctions
   are described. For energy conserving molecular dynamics the exact
   partial derivatives of the energy expression with respect to the
   numerical wavefunctions must be available. This aspect is discussed for
   all contributions to the electronic energy. The crucial point is the
   efficient iterative solution of the Poisson equation. It is shown that
   energy conserving dynamics with real space wavefunctions is possible.
   Our object oriented code is fully parallelized and efficient also for
   the investigation of systems of realistic size. (c) 2006 WILEY-VCH

   within the ensemble can then be used to estimate errors relative to
