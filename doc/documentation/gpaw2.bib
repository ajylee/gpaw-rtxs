Abstract = {{The Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS)

   the revTPSS, are implemented self-consistently within the framework of
   the projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method, using a plane wave basis set.
   Both TPSS and revTPSS yield accurate atomization energies for the
   molecules in the AE6 set, better than those of the standard
   Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized-gradient-approximation. For
   lattice constants and bulk moduli of 20 diverse solids, revTPSS performs
   much better than PBE, and on average as well as PBEsol and
   Armiento-Mattsson (AM05), GGAs designed for solids. The latter two
   overestimate the atomization energies for molecules to an unacceptable
   degree. However, the revTPSS presents only a slight improvement over
   PBEsol for the prediction of cohesive energies for solids, and some
   deterioration with respect to PBE. We also study the magnetic properties
   of Fe, for which both TPSS and revTPSS predict the right ground-state

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory we have studied the adsorption
   properties of different atoms and molecules deposited on a

   Depending on the oxidation state of the surface, electrons can flow from

   species are expected. In particular, we have found that a charge
   transfer process from or to the surface always occurs for highly
   electronegative or highly electropositive species, respectively. For
   atoms or molecules with intermediate electron affinity, the direction of
   the charge flow depends on the oxidation state of the rutile surface and
   on the adsorption site. Generally, the charging effect leads to more
   stable complexes. However, the increase in the binding energy of the
   adsorbates is highly dependent on the electronic states of the surface
   prior to the adsorption event. In this work we have analyzed in details
   these mechanisms and we have also established a direct correlation

Abstract = {{Electronic and spectral properties of small TiO(2) particles have been
   studied in order to gain more knowledge on their dependence on the
   crystal- and particle-size distributions. Our goal is to extend the
   recently developed light scattering based method for determining
   submicrometer size particles to nanoparticles. For that, we need to know
   how the refractive index function depends on the cluster size. As a
   first step, we have used time-dependent density functional theory
   (TDDFT) calculations having a focus on the shape changes of the
   calculated spectra, which can be related to changes in the refractive
   index function. Starting from the structure of TiO(2) molecule for the
   two smallest particles and truncated bulk anatase structure for larger
   particles, the structures for (TiO(2))(n) clusters, n = \{1, 2, 8, 18,
   28, 38\}, have been modeled. After the structure optimization using
   standard density functional theory (DFT) approach, the photoabsorption
   spectra for the optimized particle structures have been calculated by
   using TDDFT calculations. The results show slight evidence of the band
   gap broadening in the case of three out of the smallest particles and
   strong structural dependence of electronic and spectral properties,
   which can partly be related to the transformation of the electron
   structure, and breaking of the crystal symmetry as the size of the
   particle becomes smaller. These findings indicate that in the case of
   small particles their refractive index function can differ from the bulk
   values, and this has to be taken into account in the interpretation of

Abstract = {{Transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) is a promising spectroscopic tool

   Importantly, V(min) is approximately half the voltage required to see a
   peak in the dI/dV curve. Information about the molecular level position
   can thus be obtained at relatively low voltages. In this work we show
   that the molecular level position can be determined at even lower

   alpha < 2. On the basis of a simple Lorentzian transmission model we
   analyze theoretical ab initio as well as experimental I -V curves and

   examples of a semiconducting and metallic substrate. On SiC(0001), the
   long wavelength pi plasmons are significantly damped although their
   energies remain almost unaltered. On Al(111), the long wavelength pi
   plasmons are completely quenched due to the coupling to the metal
   surface plasmon. The strong damping of the plasmon excitations occurs
   despite the fact that the single-particle band structure of graphene is
   completely unaffected by the substrates illustrating the nonlocal nature
   of the effect.}},

Abstract = {{Optical absorption of a gold nanocluster of 102 Au atoms protected by 44
   para-mercaptobenzoic acid (p-MBA) ligands is measured in the range of
   0.05-6.2 eV (mid-IR to UV) by a combination of several techniques for
   purified samples in solid and solution phases. The results are compared
   to calculations for a model cluster Au(102)(SMe)(44) based on the
   time-dependent density functional theory in the linear-response regime
   and using the known structure of Au(102)(p-MBA)(44). The measured and
   calculated molar absorption coefficients in the NIR-vis region are
   comparable, within a factor of 2, in the absolute scale. Several
   characteristic features are observed in the absorption in the range of
   1.5-3.5 eV. The onset of the electronic transitions in the mid-IR region
   is experimentally observed at 0.45 +/- 0.05 eV which compares well with
   the lowest calculated transition at 0.55 eV. Vibrations in the ligand
   layer give rise to fingerprint IR features below the onset of low-energy
   metal-to-metal electronic transitions. Partial exchange of the p-MBA
   ligand to glutathione does not affect the onset of the electronic
   transitions, which indicates that the metal core of the cluster is not
   affected by the ligand exchange. The full spectroscopic characterization
   of the Au(102)(p-MBA)(44) reported here for the first time gives
   benchmarks for further studies of manipulation and functionalization of
   this nanocluster to various applications.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic conductance of a benzene molecule connected to gold
   electrodes via thiol, thiolate, or amino anchoring groups is calculated
   using nonequilibrium Green functions in combination with the fully
   self-consistent GW approximation for exchange and correlation. The
   calculated conductance of benzenedithiol and benzenediamine is one-fifth
   that predicted by standard density functional theory (DFT), in very good
   agreement with experiments. In contrast, the widely studied
   benzenedithiolate structure is found to have a significantly higher
   conductance due to the unsaturated sulfur bonds. These findings suggest
   that more complex gold-thiolate structures where the thiolate anchors
   are chemically passivated by Au adatoms are responsible for the measured
   conductance. Analysis of the energy level alignment obtained with DFT,
   Hartree-Fock, and GW reveals the importance of self-interaction
   corrections (exchange) on the molecule and dynamical screening at the
   metal-molecule interface. The main effect of the GW self-energy is to
   renormalize the level positions; however, its influence on the shape of
   molecular resonances also affects the conductance. Non-self-consistent
   G(0)W(0) calculations, starting from either DFT or Hartree-Fock, yield
   conductance values within 50\% of the self-consistent GW results.}},

Abstract = {{We present a systematic study of electronic gap states in defected
   titania using our implementation of the Hubbard-U approximation in the
   grid-based projector-augmented wave density functional theory code,
   GPAW. The defects considered are Ti interstitials, O vacancies, and H
   dopants in the rutile phase of bulk titanium dioxide. We find that by
   applying a sufficiently large value for the Hubbard-U parameter of the
   Ti 3d states, the excess electrons localize spatially at the Ti sites
   and appear as states in the band gap. At U=2.5 eV, the position in
   energy of these gap states are in fair agreement with the experimental
   observations. In calculations with several excess electrons and U=2.5
   eV, all of these end up in gap states that are spatially localized
   around specific Ti atoms, thus effectively creating one Ti(3+) ion per
   excess electron. An important result of this investigation is that
   regardless of which structural defect is the origin of the gap states,
   at U=2.5 eV, these states are found to have their mean energies within a
   few hundredths of an eV from 0.94 eV below the conduction band minimum.
