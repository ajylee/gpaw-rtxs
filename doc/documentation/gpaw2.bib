   The methodology is illustrated with binding energy curves for C in the

   results from the Hartree-Fock (HF) formalism and the optimized effective
   potential formalism in the so-called KLI approximation {[}Krieger, Li,
   and Iafrate, Phys. Rev. A 45, 101 (1992)] with those of the local
   density approximation. While the work here uses pure Fock exchange only,
   the formalism can be extended to treat orbital-dependent functionals
   more generally.}},

Abstract = {{Dissociation of the first C-H bond of methane was investigated at the
   interface of partial PdO(101) monolayer and supporting Pd(100) surface
   with density functional calculations. Activation pathways of CH(4) on
   the bulk PdO(100), PdO(101), Pd(100), and Pd(100) supported PdO(101)
   monolayer surfaces were also examined. The PdO(101)@:Pd(100) boundary
   enables several new routes for methane dissociation compared to the bulk
   surfaces, the lowest activation energy barrier being 0.8 eV. The barrier
   on the most stable and dominant bulk PdO(100) surface is as high as 1.2
   eV, whereas on the lower proportion bulk PdO(101) surface it is only 0.5
   eV. However, the corresponding barrier increases to 1.2 eV in the case
   of supported PdO(101) monolayer. A low activation energy of 0.7 eV is
   observed also on the Pd(100) surface, however, the reaction enthalpy on
   the metal surface is not as favored as on oxide surfaces or at the phase
   boundary. Hydrogen diffusion from metal to oxide phase can improve the
   reaction enthalpy, but it causes increase in the total activation
   energy. Overall, the results indicate that the presence of phase
   boundary between PdO and Pd enhances the activity in methane combustion,
   rationalizing experimental findings.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Surface state localization and hybridization on B, Mg, and Li terminated
   MgB(2)(0001) surfaces are studied within density functional theory
   (DFT). For the B terminated surface we find a low energy B sigma(1)
   surface state, a sp(z) surface state, and B sigma(2) and sigma(3)
   quantum well states, which are 90\% localized in the topmost B layer.
   Our results demonstrate that by charging the B atomic layer, either by
   changing the surface termination or through electro-chemical doping, the
   B sigma surface states are shifted down in energy, filled, and
   delocalize through hybridization as they cross the bulk MgB(2) bulk
   bands. On the other hand, the spz surface state should be shifted up in
   energy, emptied, and gain an increasingly metallic s character by adding
   a Mg, Mg(+1), or Li terminating atomic layer. These results clearly show
   both the robust nature of MgB(2)(0001) surface states, and how their
   localization and energy range may be tuned by surface termination and
   charging, with implications for the superconducting and plasmonic
   behavior of MgB(2).}},

Abstract = {{To compute molecular and material properties, one must solve the

   briefly presents nonspectral (pseudospectral and grid) methods to solve
   the Schrodinger equation and their recent and promising applications to
   vibrational and electronic problems. Pseudospectral and grid methods
   facilitate parallelization, which is of critical importance for modern
   material modeling applications. By obviating the need to choose basis
   functions for which exact integrals are possible, they also enable one
   to use smaller basis sets. For the vibrational problem, pseudospectral
   and grid methods, in principle, make it possible to compute a
   vibrational spectrum without a potential surface, simply from values of
   the potential at points. This is possible if optimized basis functions
   are used. Iterative eigensolvers are very advantageous when simpler
   basis functions are used because matrix-vector products can be evaluated

Abstract = {{Effects of atomic layer deposited (ALD) aluminum oxide barriers on
   electron injection, recombination reactions, and efficiency of
   dye-sensitized solar cells were studied. The amorphous AlO(x)
   submonolayers prepared on nanocrystalline 2 mu m thick TiO(2) anatase
   film were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy. Time-of-flight elastic recoil detection method was employed
   to study the growth of similar AlO(x) layers on planar anatase films.
   Density functional theory calculations of the first ALD cycle over a
   (101) anatase surface revealed atomic scale roughness of the deposited
   layer owing to unequal adsorption sites and lateral repulsions between
   adsorbed precursor molecules. Calculations also indicate that the holes

   bipyridyl sensitizer to reach the TiO(2) surface. After the first
   deposition cycle the dye binds to AlO(x) and is in average about 0.2 nm
   farther from the TiO(2) surface than when binding to the bare TiO(2)
   surface. Increase in average distance between the dye and TiO(2) surface
   was considered as the main reason for reduced electron injection
   efficiency observed for all coated sensitized films. Electrochemical
   impedance spectroscopy indicated that also recombination reactions of
   the conduction band electrons with the electrolyte triiodide molecules
   were reduced. The exponential increase in charge transfer resistance at
   the dye-TiO(2)-electrolyte interface as a function of the number of ALD
   cycles indicated that AlO(x) barrier layers affect recombination mainly
   through the tunnel barrier mechanism. Decrease of both the short circuit
   current and efficiency of the solar cells prepared from above-mentioned
   films as the number of ALD cycles was increased suggests that the
   suppression of the recombination could not compensate for the
   barrier-induced losses of electron injection.}},

Abstract = {{Soft-landed adsorption of Au(16) on bilayered graphene is investigated
   using density functional theory. The orientation of the Au(16) cluster
   and number of neighboring surface vacancies affect the overall
   structural and electronic properties of the cluster. The results of the
   PBE, vdW-DF, and vdW-DF2 exchange-correlation functionals are compared
   for the cluster-substrate interaction for systems with and without
   defects. In the presence of defects size two and greater, an Au atom
   adsorbs into the topmost graphene layer; this strongly influences the
   binding energy (>3 eV), while inducing substantial bending in the carbon
   plane and altering electronic properties of the system. Though the
   T(d)-symmetry and electronegative properties of the Au(16) structure
   change in the presence of greater neighboring defects, elements of the
   cagelike starting structure remain throughout. The electron localization
   function shows that the in-plane Au-C bonds are of delocalized
   (metallic) nature and there is a local charge transfer to the
   coordinating Au. However, the net charge transfer between adsorbate and
   substrate is considerable only for the defect-free case (0.8e to
   Au(16)). Finally, the binding of O(2) molecules to the adsorbed Au(16)
   cluster is used to probe the potential catalytic activity of graphite
   and carbon nanotube systems, and in one case (for defect size two) the
   adsorbed O(2) switches on the catalytically active superoxo-state.}},

Abstract = {{Os(II)/(III) and Co(II)/(III) polypyridine complexes in aqueous solution
   are robust molecular entities both in freely solute state and adsorbed
   on Au(111)- and Pt(111)-electrode surfaces. This class of robust
   coordination chemical compounds have recently been characterized by
   electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (in situ STM). The
   Os-complexes were found to display strong tunneling spectroscopic (STS)
   features at the level of resolution of the single molecule while STS
   features of the Co complexes, although clear, were much weaker. The data
   was framed by concise but phenomenological theory of interfacial
   electrochemical electron transfer extended to the electrochemical in
   situ STM configuration. With a view on first-principle insight into the
   in situ STM behavior of robust redox (as opposed to nonredox) molecules,
   we present in this report a density functional theory (DFT) study of the
   complexes in both free and adsorbate state, in either state exposed to
   both stoichiometric counterions and a large assembly of solvent water
   molecules. The oxidation states of the complexes were controlled, first
   by introducing chlorine counter atoms followed by spontaneous attraction
   of electrons from the complexes, also at first in electrostatically
   neutral form. Second, the solvent is found to provide strong dielectric
   screening of this charge transfer process and to be crucial for
   achieving the full chemically meaningful charge separated ionic
   oxidation states. The molecular charge and structure of the complexes in
   the presence of the solvent, are conserved upon adsorption, whereas the
   structural features of the different oxidation states are completely
   lost upon adsorption under vacuum conditions. Detailed microscopic
   insight such as offered by the present study will be important in
   molecular-based approaches to ``smart{''} redox molecules enclosed in in
   situ STM or other nanoscale and single-molecules scale configurations in
   condensed matter environments.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{We propose thermoelectric devices where a single molecule is connected
   to two metallic zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) via highly
   transparent contacts that allow the injection of evanescent wave
   functions from ZGNRs. Their overlap generates a peak in the electronic
   transmission that is largely insensitive to the type of the short
   conjugated molecule, while ZGNRs additionally suppress hole-like
   contributions to the thermopower. Thus optimized thermopower, together
   with suppression of phonon transport through a ZGNR-molecule-ZGNR
   structure, yields the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT similar to 0.5
   at room temperature and 0.5 < ZT < 2.5 below liquid nitrogen
   temperature. Using density functional theory combined with the
   nonequilibrium Green's function formalism for multiterminal devices, we
   show how the transmission resonance can be manipulated by the voltage
   applied to a third ZGNR top-gate electrode covering the molecule to
   further tune the value of ZT.}},

   intrinsic semiconductor after surface doping by hydrazine, and become a
   p-type semiconductor after doping by the hydrazine fragments. We

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory we have studied the adsorption
   properties of different atoms and molecules deposited on a
   stoichiometric, reduced, and oxidized rutile TiO(2)(110) surface.
   Depending on the oxidation state of the surface, electrons can flow from
   or to the substrate and, therefore, negatively or positively charged
   species are expected. In particular, we have found that a charge
   transfer process from or to the surface always occurs for highly
   electronegative or highly electropositive species, respectively. For
   atoms or molecules with intermediate electron affinity, the direction of
   the charge flow depends on the oxidation state of the rutile surface and
   on the adsorption site. Generally, the charging effect leads to more
   stable complexes. However, the increase in the binding energy of the
   adsorbates is highly dependent on the electronic states of the surface
   prior to the adsorption event. In this work we have analyzed in details
   these mechanisms and we have also established a direct correlation
   between the enhanced binding energy of the adsorbates and the induced
   gap states. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Electronic and spectral properties of small TiO(2) particles have been
   studied in order to gain more knowledge on their dependence on the
   crystal- and particle-size distributions. Our goal is to extend the
   recently developed light scattering based method for determining
   submicrometer size particles to nanoparticles. For that, we need to know
   how the refractive index function depends on the cluster size. As a
   first step, we have used time-dependent density functional theory
   (TDDFT) calculations having a focus on the shape changes of the
   calculated spectra, which can be related to changes in the refractive
   index function. Starting from the structure of TiO(2) molecule for the
   two smallest particles and truncated bulk anatase structure for larger
   particles, the structures for (TiO(2))(n) clusters, n = \{1, 2, 8, 18,
   28, 38\}, have been modeled. After the structure optimization using
   standard density functional theory (DFT) approach, the photoabsorption
   spectra for the optimized particle structures have been calculated by
   using TDDFT calculations. The results show slight evidence of the band
   gap broadening in the case of three out of the smallest particles and
   strong structural dependence of electronic and spectral properties,
   which can partly be related to the transformation of the electron
   structure, and breaking of the crystal symmetry as the size of the
   particle becomes smaller. These findings indicate that in the case of
   small particles their refractive index function can differ from the bulk
   values, and this has to be taken into account in the interpretation of
   light-scattering measurements.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical investigation of the hydrogenation of pyrene

Abstract = {{Transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) is a promising spectroscopic tool
   for molecular junctions. The principles in TVS is to find the minimum on
   a Fowler-Nordheim plot where ln(I/V(2)) is plotted against 1/V and
   relate the voltage at the minimum V(min) to the closest molecular level.
   Importantly, V(min) is approximately half the voltage required to see a
   peak in the dI/dV curve. Information about the molecular level position
   can thus be obtained at relatively low voltages. In this work we show
   that the molecular level position can be determined at even lower
   voltages, V(min)((alpha)), by finding the minimum of ln(I/V(alpha)) with
   alpha < 2. On the basis of a simple Lorentzian transmission model we
   analyze theoretical ab initio as well as experimental I -V curves and
   show that the voltage required to determine the molecular levels can be
   reduced by similar to 30\% as compared to conventional TVS. As for
   conventional TVS, the symmetry/asymmetry of the molecular junction needs
   to be taken into account in order to gain quantitative information. We

   accounting for coverage effects of the S and H adatoms on the Ni(111)
   surface are included in the analysis. The resulting equilibrium
   equations for the multiple adsorption/desorption reactions are then
   solved to calculate the S and H coverage over a wide range of T, P(H2S),
   and P(H2). This study illustrates the errors introduced in the predicted
   S coverage if H(2) adsorption in parallel with H(2)S adsorption is
   neglected or if the thermal corrections to the enthalpy and entropy of
   reaction are not handled properly.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of graphene nanoribbons in the presence of typical
   atmospheric molecules is systematically investigated by means of
   density-functional theory. We calculate the edge formation free energy
   of five different edge configurations passivated by H, H(2), O, O(2),
   N(2), CO, CO(2), and H(2)O, respectively. In addition to the well known
   hydrogen passivated armchair and zigzag edges, we find the edges
   saturated by oxygen atoms to be particularly stable under atmospheric
   conditions. Saturation of the zigzag edge by oxygen leads to the
   formation of metallic states strictly localized on the oxygen atoms.
   Finally, the vibrational spectrum of the hydrogen- and oxygen-passivated
   ribbons are calculated and compared.}},

Abstract = {{We present a systematic study of electronic gap states in defected
   titania using our implementation of the Hubbard-U approximation in the
   grid-based projector-augmented wave density functional theory code,
   GPAW. The defects considered are Ti interstitials, O vacancies, and H
   dopants in the rutile phase of bulk titanium dioxide. We find that by
   applying a sufficiently large value for the Hubbard-U parameter of the
   Ti 3d states, the excess electrons localize spatially at the Ti sites
   and appear as states in the band gap. At U=2.5 eV, the position in
   energy of these gap states are in fair agreement with the experimental
   observations. In calculations with several excess electrons and U=2.5
   eV, all of these end up in gap states that are spatially localized
   around specific Ti atoms, thus effectively creating one Ti(3+) ion per
   excess electron. An important result of this investigation is that
   regardless of which structural defect is the origin of the gap states,
   at U=2.5 eV, these states are found to have their mean energies within a
   few hundredths of an eV from 0.94 eV below the conduction band minimum.

Abstract = {{Quantum interference (QI) of electron pathways has recently attracted
   increased interest as an enabling tool for single-molecule electronic
   devices Although various molecular systems have been shown to exhibit QI
   effects and a number of methods have been proposed for its analysis,
   simple guidelines linking the molecular structure to QI effects in the
   phase-coherent transport regime have until now been lacking In the
   present work we demonstrate that QI in aromatic molecules is intimately
   related to the topology of the molecule's pi system and establish a
   simple graphical scheme to predict the existence of QI-induced
   transmission anuresonances The generality of the scheme, which is exact
   for a certain class of tight-binding models, is proved by a comparison
   to first-principles transport calculations for 10 different
   configurations of anthraquinone as well as a set of cross-conjugated
   molecular wires}},

Abstract = {{Transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) has recently been introduced as a
   spectroscopic tool for molecular junctions where it offers the
   possibility to probe molecular level energies at relatively low bias
   voltages. In this work we perform extensive ab initio calculations of
   the nonlinear current-voltage relations for a broad class of
   single-molecule transport junctions in order to assess the applicability
   and limitations of TVS. We find, that in order to fully utilize TVS as a
   quantitative spectroscopic tool, it is important to consider asymmetries
   in the coupling of the molecule to the two electrodes. When this is
   taken properly into account, the relation between the transition voltage
   and the energy of the molecular orbital closest to the Fermi level
   closely follows the trend expected from a simple, analytical model.}},
