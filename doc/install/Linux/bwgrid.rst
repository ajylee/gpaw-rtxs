Building GPAW with Intel compiler
=================================

Use the compiler wrapper file :svn:`~doc/install/Linux/icc.py`

.. literalinclude:: icc.py

Instructions assume **bash**, installation under $HOME/opt.
Load the necessary modules::

  module load devel/python/2.7.2
  module load compiler/intel/12.0
  module load mpi/impi/4.0.2-intel-12.0
  module load numlib/mkl/10.3.5
  module load numlib/python_numpy/1.6.1-python-2.7.2

The installation of gpaw requires to modify customize.py to
:svn:`~doc/install/Linux/customize_bwgrid_icc.py`

.. literalinclude:: customize_bwgrid_icc.py

and build GPAW (``python setup.py build_ext | tee build_ext.log``)

A gpaw script :file:`test.py` can be submitted to run on 8 cpus like this::

  > gpaw-runscript test.py 8
  using bwg
  run.bwg written
  > qsub run.bwg
